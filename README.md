This is the implementation of the paper Process Signature Characterization and Anomaly Detection with Personalized PCA in Laser-Based Metal Additive Manufacturing

## Data
- Download data (of one layer) from [this link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/in-situ-thermography-of-the-metal-bridge-structures-fabricated-for-the-2018-additive-manuf-275ac)

- Then unzip it.

- Use the matlab file proprocess.m to preprocess the data.

- copy every .pkl file into images\ folder.

- Upload everything to a google drive.

## Personalized PCA and t-SNE

Double click the main.ipynb file in google drive, it will automatically launch in google Colab. Follow the instructions there to perform analysis.
